# part 0 - fundamentals of reinforcement learning
this section includes key concepts from the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, with a focus on q-learning and markov decision processes.

## q-learning intuition

- **deep learning fundamentals: neural networks & activation functions explained**  
introduction to neural networks and how activation functions help in decision making.

- **how reinforcement learning works: a beginner's guide to ai training methods**  
explains how agents learn through interactions and rewards in an environment.

- **bellman equation in reinforcement learning: a step-by-step introduction**  
breaks down the bellman equation and its role in evaluating policies.

- **from state values to optimal plans: bellman equation in ai decision making**  
shows how state value functions lead to finding optimal policies.

- **markov decision processes in reinforcement learning: a complete guide**  
explains the components of mdps: states, actions, rewards, and transitions.

- **rl tutorial: optimal policy vs fixed plans in ai decision making**  
compares dynamic optimal policies with fixed action plans.

- **living penalty in reinforcement learning: optimize ai agent decision making**  
introduces step penalties to encourage shorter, more efficient solutions.

- **q-learning in reinforcement learning: from v-values to q-values explained**  
explains how q-values extend state values by incorporating actions.
- **temporal difference in q-learning: a complete guide for reinforcement learning**  
describes how agents update their knowledge using td learning.

- **finally,** [**q-learning implementation**](https://github.com/burcia1711/artificial-intelligence-2025-agentic-ai-gen-ai-and-rl/tree/main/Section%204%20-%20A%20Q-Learning%20Implementation%20for%20Process%20Optimization)
